# RandomizerPackage
 
Program to re-generate BL3 Spawn and Skill Randomizers in order to create different experiences. Files are created inside the same folder as the exe. 

The actual GUI window will take a little bit to come up and load, that is normal due to the assets coming with it.

See Releases tab to actually download the exe.

(Credit to apocalyptech for the original of the bl3data.py, I am using a stripped version of that here to transport with the exe)
