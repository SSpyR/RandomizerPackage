This is a little confusing but best I could do for now

1. Unpack ZIP (If Not Already Done)
2. Download the Latest Version of Python 3 if Not Installed Already
3. Download Pip for Python
4. Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the Package Directory
5. Whenever you want to launch the program, run "py randomize.py" or "python randomize.py"
